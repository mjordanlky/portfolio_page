Jordan Larimore's portfolio page

Brief Description of Website:
    This is my Portfolio Page where I'm able to share interesting articles, videos, pictures of my family and woodworking projects, and a brief description about be (my interests, hobbies, etc.). I included jQuery Lightbox to the "family pictures" and "woodworking" pages.


Constants on every page:
    Navigation Bar:
        You'll find the Navigation Bar (Bootstrap) at the top of the page. It gives the option to select the Home Page, Family Pictures Page, Woodworking Page, and About Page. This will be constant no matter what page. Whatever page is selected, it will be highlighted in a darker shade of black and the text will turn from grey to white.
        The Navigation Bar will minimize in the mobile view and transform into a drop down menu when selected. 

    Footer:
        There are logos with links to my LinkedIn Account, Facebook Account, and direct link to contact me via Twitter.
        Below the links you'll find the copyright logo with my name

    Background:
        The same picture is shown throughout the website as my background image


home page (run index.html):
The home page explains what you'll find on all the pages found on my portfolio website. It includes links to articles of various topics and a picture to represet each link. It also includes a video I decided to share that plays automatically once selected. There are breakpoints for:
        Mobile view: stacked on top of one another, the video being first
        Small laptop/tablet view: video on top, two articles below to the left, and two articles below to the right
        Large screen/desktop view: the video in the middle of the page with two articles in a column to the left, and the other two articles in a column to the right


family pictures page (run famPics.html):
The family pictures page showcases pictures with my family. A JavaScript Lightbox will show on window sizes greater than 768 pixels (greater than mobile view). There are breakpoints for:
        Mobile view: Pictures shown in columns
        Small laptop/tablet view: Pictures shown in rows, two pictures per row
        Large screen/desktop view: Pictures shown in rows, three pictures per row


woodworking page (run wwPics.html):
The woodworking page showcases pictures with my different woodworking projects. A JavaScript Lightbox will show on window sizes greater than 768 pixels (greater than mobile view). There are breakpoints for:
        Mobile view: Pictures shown in columns
        Small laptop/tablet view: Pictures shown in rows, two pictures per row
        Large screen/desktop view: Pictures shown in rows, three pictures per row


about page (run about.html):
The about page first displays picture of me playing golf. Below the picture I give a brief summary of the website and a overview of my interests and hobbies. Within the text is a link to follow me on Twitter. There is a breakpoint for the large screen/desktop view. Once the breakpoint is reached, the picture appears to the left, and the text will appear in a column to the right of the picture.
